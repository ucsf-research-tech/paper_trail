## Framework Version 3

See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

* The convention for the **icon** parameter for links specified in config.json has changed to expect [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) icon classes (ex: `fas fa-receipt`) instead of a REDCap image resource name. A path to an icon filename in your module may also be specified (ex: `images/my-icon.png`). All link icons will need to be updated when switching to this framework version.  Old icons may still be used by copying them into your module directory.  They may disappear from REDCap core at any point.
* If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.
