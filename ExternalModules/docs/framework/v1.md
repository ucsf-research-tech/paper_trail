## Framework Version 1

**This framework version is DEPRECATED for new modules, and upgrading is recommended for existing modules.**  See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for the latest framework version and more details on framework versions in general.

The REDCap External Module framework was first added to REDCap in Standard Release 8.0.0. It first appeared in REDCap LTS at 8.1.2. The original/default version of the module API was rebranded as _Framework Version 1_ when _Framework Version 2_ was released.  Methods were originally intended to be accessed directly from the module class (ex: `$this->getModuleName()`).  This still works, but has been deprecated in _Framework Version 2_.

Since each module's main class extends **AbstractExternalModule**, the following built-in methods are available.  They can be called by using **$this** (e.g., `$this->getModuleName()`).
